bio:
  life: |
    I was raised in Queens, New York, by my Aunt May and Uncle Ben after my parents passed away.
    My childhood was filled with curiosity and a deep love for science and discovery.
    Life took an extraordinary turn when I was bitten by a radioactive spider, giving me
    unique abilities. Balancing a normal life while fulfilling my responsibility to use
    my powers for good has been my greatest challenge and purpose.
  education: |
    I graduated from Midtown High School as a top student, particularly excelling in science.
    I went on to study biophysics at Empire State University, where I continued to cultivate
    my passion for innovation and problem-solving.
  work: |
    My career has been a mix of freelance photography and science-focused work.
    I have worked as a photographer for The Daily Bugle, capturing moments that matter most
    to the city, especially those involving Spider-Man. I also dedicate time to scientific
    projects, pushing the boundaries of innovation while striving to make a difference.
  family: |
    My Aunt May has been my rock, guiding me through life with love and wisdom.
    My Uncle Ben taught me one of life's most valuable lessons: "With great power comes great responsibility."
  friends: |
    My friends are few but close. People like MJ and Harry Osborn have been by my side through thick and thin,
    reminding me that even heroes need someone to lean on.
  pets: |
    I donâ€™t have any pets, but I often feel a special connection to spiders, given my unique abilities.
    They are fascinating creatures, and I respect their role in nature.
  health: |
    Thanks to my enhanced physiology, my health is generally excellent, but maintaining balance
    between my physical and mental well-being can be challenging. The weight of responsibility
    and the danger I face take a toll, reminding me to prioritize rest and self-care whenever possible.
